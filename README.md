# Contextual Job Description Matcher

The `Contextual Job Description Matcher` will allow users to upload resumes and job descriptions (PDF or text), analyze skills and requirements using RAG with LangChain, Chroma, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o, and provide match scores, skill gap analysis, and actionable suggestions (e.g., resume tweaks, skill development).

The project is designed to be scalable, modular, and AWS free-tier friendly. It supports uploads in `.pdf` and `.txt` formats, processes documents contextually, and outputs meaningful match insights.
